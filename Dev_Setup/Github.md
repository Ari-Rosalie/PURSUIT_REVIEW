# GitHub Quick Summary

GitHub is an online platform for managing and sharing code, enabling collaboration among developers globally. It integrates with `git`, a version control system that works locally on your machine. GitHub allows you to store and share code, back up projects, and collaborate with others through features like forks and pull requests.

## Key Points:

### 1. **Git vs. GitHub**:
   - **Git**: A version control system that operates locally on your machine.
   - **GitHub**: A cloud service for hosting git repositories, enabling collaboration and code sharing.

### 2. **Repositories**:
   - GitHub repositories contain your code, files, and commits. They include a **README.md** for project details.
   - **Visual parts**: Account name, repository name, commit history, and files.

### 3. **Connecting Local to Remote**:
   - Use `git remote add origin <url>` to link a local repository to GitHub.
   - Push local commits to GitHub with `git push`.

### 4. **Collaboration**:
   - **Forking**: Create a copy of a repository to make changes.
   - **Cloning**: Copy a repository to your local machine.
   - **Pull Requests**: Propose changes from your fork to the original repo for review.

### 5. **Basic GitHub Workflow**:
   - **Fork** a repository to work independently.
   - **Clone** it to your local machine.
   - **Make changes**, **commit**, and **push** your code.
   - Create a **pull request** to suggest merging your changes with the original repository.

## Commands:
- `git remote add origin <url>`: Connect local repo to GitHub.
- `git branch -M main`: Set the branch name to "main."
- `git push -u origin main`: Push local changes to GitHub.

GitHub is essential for collaboration, enabling asynchronous work and keeping your projects in sync across teams or solo work.
