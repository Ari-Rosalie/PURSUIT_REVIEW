# Intro To Algorithms


Algorithms are a set of instructions used to solve a specific problem or complete a task.


### Writing Algorithms


WHen writing algorithms keep in mind the following questions:


What is the desired output of this algorithm?
What inputs are required to achieve this outcome?
What set of steps need to be followed in order to achieve the output?

### Edge Cases and "happy path"

Edge cases are defined as an unaccounted factor that need to be considered when writing algorithms.

A happy path refers to the ideal scenario in which a program runs without errors or unexpected issues. It follows the intended flow, where users provide correct input, and everything works smoothly.
