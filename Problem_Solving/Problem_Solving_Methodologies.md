# Problem Solving Methodologies


### Polya's Problem Solving method

1. Understand the Problem

-Ensure you fully understand the question and what information is provided. 
-Rephrase the problem in your own words to ensure comprehension. 
-Consider any terminology or notation used in the problem. 
-Identify the knowns and unknowns. 
-Ask yourself: What is the problem asking me to find? What information is given? 
-Can you visualize the problem, and might a diagram help?


2. Devise a plan
-Develop a strategy for solving the problem, consider previous experiences with similar problems, and what resources are available. 
-Try solving a simpler version of the problem or a related problem if the original is challenging. 
-Possible strategies include drawing a diagram, making a list, solving a simpler problem, looking for a pattern, guessing and checking, or using a variable. 
-How are you going to attack the problem?

3. Carry Out the Plan:
-Implement your chosen strategy and follow the plan, being meticulous and accurate in your calculations. 
-Work carefully, especially if there are calculations involved. 

4.  Look Back:
-Double-check your answer and make sure it is reasonable. 
-Evaluate the solution: Does it make sense? Did you answer the question?. 
-Is there a better way to solve the problem? 
-Can you generalize your solution to other similar problems? 



### Reminders when solving coding problems
1. WHen solving coding problems always take into account input and outputs

2.  Consider coding paths i.e if/else can be switch or implement methods like .push()

3. Check for correctness

4. Make improvements 
-Can you make the code easier to read? Perhaps you need to add comments, or update some variable names to be more clear.
-Can you make the code more efficient? Perhaps you can rethink how you loop through data, or how much memory a solution uses.
-Can you remove any duplicate code blocks? Perhaps you can make helper functions or leverage scope in a different way.
-Can you refactor the code to be more reusable for the future? Perhaps you can change hardcoded values to variables that may be changed in the future.
